# Slidegame
A clone of the classic 2048 game, but for java.  The game logic is modeled after the 2048 game, which can be found at [https://play2048.co](https://play2048.co).  Source can be found at [https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048).  Tile adding logic and tile colors copied from source.  Logic implemented via my imagination and observations from playing the original game.
